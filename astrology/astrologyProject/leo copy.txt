Your Element is Fire*Like fire itself, fire signs tend to be passionate, dynamic, and *temperamental.

As a result,fire signs need to be nurtured and managed carefully.*
Your Flower is a Sunflower*Perhaps the only people more social and outgoing than Geminis are those*born under the Leo sign. With their happy demeanor bringing a smile to *everyone’s face they meet, it’s only natural that their flower is just*as “sunny” as them!*
Your Gemstone is Tourmaline*Tourmaline is often associated with the heart, the part of the body ruled*by Leo. This stone can help you open yourself to love, and it enhances*compassion, happiness and serenity. Leo is a naturally creative zodiac*sign, and tourmaline provides added inspiration -- or can help jumpstart*the process if you're feeling blocked. Tourmaline strengthens your *ability to manifest your goals, and it attracts abundance and prosperity*as it makes others more receptive to your talents. Traditionally used as*a meditation stone, tourmaline is also considered helpful for channeling.**Additional gemstones associated with Leo:*Carnelian*Sardonyx*Onyx*Golden Topaz*
Your Ruling Planet is the Sun*Your sign is governed by the sun. The sun is the center of our solar system*,which is the reason you enjoy being the center of attention so much.*Bright and vibrant, it brings warmth to everyone, much like you.*But the sun is also hot and can burn you if you get too close.*The same can be said for you. When you get irritated, your temper tends to*flare out of control.*
Your Color is Gold*Glistening gold empowers Leo’s warm heart and strengthens its positive*spirit. Shining with royalty and class, gold has always been a symbol of*power and prestige. So it’s no wonder Leo -- the King of the Jungle -- is*stirred by this expressive hue. Gold gives Leo the attention it wants, and*supports its generous nature and warm, optimistic outlook on life.*
Your Tarot Card is Strength*The Strength card represents your physical strength -- like that of the*mighty Lion on your card -- as well as your emotional, mental and spiritual*prowess. Like the Lion, you are blessed with plenty of courage, which helps*you overcome problems and obstacles.*
Your Ruling House is 5th House of Pleasure*Let the Lion loose! As the fifth sign of the zodiac, warm-hearted Leo rules *over the 5th House of Pleasure. Both playful and full of energy, Leo the *Lion feels right at home in this house that’s all about fun, creativity, *and expression. And thanks to Leo’s frisky, flirty ways, this house also *holds great clues to your romantic life, and the rewards love holds *for you.*

The Dominant Lover*A born leader, the Leo is always dominating in the relationship. They need *a partner who would submit to them and their desires. Always a center of *attraction, the Leo becomes generous when it comes to their significant *others but they need to be pampered always because they become insecure *occasionally.*
The Life of the Party Friend*Leo, it should come as no surprise to you or anyone else in your squad *that you are the Life of the Party Friend. Not only are you a fun-loving, *light-hearted person who loves to have fun, but you also make sure that *your friends feel the warmth of the spotlight, too.**For you, a party is so much better when you’ve got your BFF right next to *you when you’re dancing on a tabletop at the bar.**But besides being popular and well-liked by pretty much everyone, you’re *also a powerful leader, which shouldn’t be discounted.**Yes, you’re the life of the actual party, but you’re also the one who *pumps your squad up when your weekends together are getting a little stale *or if they need a cheerleader to keep them motivated to succeed in life.*

Pet Peeve*SOMEONE ELSE GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION*You love appearing like the most generous and thoughtful person, but *secretly, you're doing it all for the praise. When it comes down to it, *actually letting someone else have the spotlight grinds your gears. I bet *you've already got a plan to get the focus back on you.*
The Jealousy*Jealousy is second nature to Leo and therefore becomes the cause of his *misfortune. The Lion can not hide it, which makes him unhappy to the point.*
Fear & Insecurity*Their most common fear is being ignored or forgotten. Leo’s hate feeling *invisible, which could be to do to with their ego, so they fear being *ignored or falling out with others and being forgotten.**As they are quite confident and enthusiastic, Leos often want others to see *them as having this persona too. Their biggest insecurity is their ego. They *may look like they have it all together, but sometimes they may not be *showing how they truly feel.*
3rd Most Jealous*Leos are arguably the most lovable and passionate of the signs. They *understand when things don’t go their way and won’t throw a fit about it. *But, something that turns their jealousy switch on is when their partner *pays attention to someone or something else more than them. A Leo craves *attention from everyone around them and if they don’t get it, they’re a *jealous wreck.*
Advice*Leos have a tendency to compare their lives to others, or wish their life *looked a little different. However, this does nothing but allow depression *to set in, and sucks the joy right out from under you. Learn to love your *life now, and improve upon it as you go. Set goals and go after them, *because complaining about your life won’t get you anywhere. Use your *confident, cheerful attitude to your advantage, and do whatever your *heart guides you to. Water your own grass, and don’t worry about how *it looks on the other side of the fence.*

Best Match*Aries: Aries natives and Leo natives have such similar temperaments that *they can’t help but share a mutual understanding of one another. Both are *passionate, energetic, and slightly egotistical, but as long as they take *care to respect one another, this can be more of an asset than a liability. *Both also share a mutual love of sex, making their sex life a key bonding *point when it comes to their relationship.*
Worst Match*Capricorn: There are few signs that are more complete opposites than Leo *and Capricorn. They speak different languages and see eye to eye on little. *Capricorn’s lack of creativity and imagination disappoints passionate, *artistic Leo while Leo’s impulsiveness aggravates conservative, reserved *Capricorn. Nor are they the best sexual match, each possessing a totally *different outlook and energy level when it comes to sex.*
Shrug it off*You are one of the signs that do not take it well when someone breaks up*you. It makes you very upset. But it's alright. Not everyone deserves you.*It hurts but being dumped doesnt make you any less of a person than you*already are. Shrug it off and say 'Your Loss'*
Leo + Aries*Bold Aries and fun-loving Leo generate lots of excitement together! That's *because both these friends are Fire Signs. Aries is the more outgoing of *the two and may prefer seeking adventure while Leo luxuriates in comfort, *waiting for a full report. These friends are also extremely active and may *enjoy playing sports, thus bringing out each other's competitive side. *Neither sign is a particularly gracious loser, so some heated arguments *can erupt on the field or court. For the most part, however, each friend *will bask in the other's glow.*
Leo + Taurus*Taurus and Leo have more in common than meets the eye. Both love luxury. *Each is extremely loyal. The two of them are incredibly stubborn. When *they become friends, it's usually because they appreciate each other's *taste. These two can often be found shopping, eating, and making or *appreciating art together. Taurus hates being ordered around, which *can cause problems when Leo issues royal commands. Leo dislikes Taurus's *frugality. Fortunately, they're both very friendly. Most days, they prefer *having fun to fighting.*
Leo + Gemini*Effusive and affectionate, Gemini and Leo form a fast friendship. They *form a mutual admiration society that is positively addictive. Gemini is *quick to appreciate Leo's style, creative talent, and warmth. Leo loves *laughing at Gemini's witty remarks. These two are very adventurous and *enjoy getting into trouble together. Fortunately, Gemini is an expert *at talking their way out of punishments. This is the one instance when *Leo should follow their friend's lead. At all other times, Gemini should *defer to Leo's sizable ego. This is a fun-loving pair.*
Leo + Cancer*At first, Cancer and Leo don't know what to make of each other. Modest *Cancer is shocked by proud Leo's bragging. Fun-loving Leo can't understand *Cancer's tearful outbursts. Instead of writing each other off, these signs *should take a second look at each other. The Moon Child can greatly *benefit from Leo's playful attitude. The Lion can become more sensitive *under Cancer's tender influence. They're both extremely loyal and will *stick together through thick and thin. This friendship can be a rewarding *balancing act of energies*
Leo + Leo*Two Leos are a bundle of fun, but they can encounter trouble in their *friendship.

They have a fondness for sports and adore luxuriating *in the sun. If they can tame their egos, this friendship will thrive.*
Leo + Virgo*Leo and Virgo are funny friends. Leo is grandiose, while Virgo is humble. *The Virgin is critical, while the Lion is effusive. Despite these *differences, Leo and Virgo can greatly benefit from each other's company. *Leo can reconcile Virgo to their sensual side. Virgo can warn trusting Leo *of opportunists in their midst. Both want to maintain optimal health, *and may share wellness tips. Of course, Leo will accuse Virgo of being *uptight, while the Virgin will charge the Lion with being selfish. They'll *never change each other, though.*
Leo + Libra*Leo and Libra make fabulous friends. Both are lovers of life and fuel each *other's positive energy. Leo is enchanted by Libra's wit and *sophistication, while Libra adores the Lion's warmth and generosity. *Forceful Leo laughs at Libra's indecision, while collaborative Libra mocks *the Lion's selfishness. Fortunately, each finds the other's weaknesses *relatively minor. Both enjoy being entertained and will often accompany *each other to movies, concerts, and plays. They're also enthusiastic game *players and may enter trivia contests, poker tournaments, or *sporting competitions.*
Leo + Scorpio*Both signs are emotional creatures that demand lots of attention. The *difference is that Leo loves the spotlight, while Scorpio prefers operating *in the shadows. When the Lion doesn't get the accolades they expect, *they'll emit a mighty roar. If Scorpio isn't getting respect, they'll *remain silent and formulate plans for revenge. When these two put an end *to their power struggles, they can bring wonderful things to one another. *Leo can help Scorpio look at the bright side, while Scorpio will assist *the Lion in developing their creative talent.*
Leo + Sagittarius*Leo and Sagittarius love being together. Playful Leo delights in the *Archer's irreverent humor. Energetic Sagittarius appreciates the Lion's *tremendous energy. They'll have fun traveling, playing sports, and *causing a commotion. Leo privately thinks Sagittarius is a bit of a flake, *while the Archer bluntly asserts that the Lion is an egotist. Although *these differences will cause some loud arguments, neither sign takes these *spats too seriously. These friends understand that life is much nicer when *they're together than when they're apart.*
Leo + Capricorn*Although fun-loving Leo may not feel an immediate connection with reserved *Capricorn, these two can form a good friendship. Both these signs place a *tremendous importance on dignity. Neither would dream of making fun of *each other's weak points. Both possess a marvelous sense of humor. The *Lion's wit is silly, while the Goat's humor is dry, but they do make each *other laugh. Of course, Leo will find Capricorn's obsession with fiscal *responsibility tiresome, while the Goat will think the Lion's ego *ridiculous. Still, they are loyal friends*
Leo + Aquarius*The differences between Leo and Aquarius are epic. Leo demands a starring *role, while Aquarius prefers being part of a supporting cast. The Lion *loves luxury, while the Water Bearer is indifferent to creature comforts. *Leo loves physical pleasure, while Aquarius occupies the realm of ideas. *Still, these two can be great friends. The Lion will help Aquarius get in *touch with their emotions, while the Water Bearer will make Leo aware of *their place in the social network. They also appreciate each other's *ability to create security and stability.*
Leo + Pisces*Leo and Pisces form an unusual alliance. Outgoing Leo is mystified by the *Fish's reclusive ways. Introverted Pisces will tire of the Lion's *self-centered stories. However, all is not lost on the friendship front. *Both signs have a deep appreciation for fantasy and glamour. They'll find *they share lots of the same taste in movies. They'll admire each other's *fashion sense. Above all, they'll connect over their mutual desire to *transcend mundane reality. If Leo can put up with Pisces's tearful *outbursts, Pisces will tolerate the Lion's gargantuan ego.*
Aries & Leo*An Aries and a Leo are best friends for several reasons. Where do I start?*First, we know a Leo loves to have control, is abrasive and confrontational,*yet has incredibly leadership skills. An Aries girl has great leadership *skills as well, but knows when to let things go and let someone else take *control. She absolutely does not need control, like a Leo girl. *Furthermore, they are both direct and can be honest with each other no *matter what the case is. Lastly, they are both incredibly independent, *so they can hang out with each other and do their own thing or make plans *together too. Ironically, they are very chill around each other, even *though they can be really uptight in every other aspect of life.*
Leo & Pisces*This one is obvious, right? A Pisces girl is emotional, sensitive, *idealistic, and imaginative. She loves being in love and loves having dear *friends that care about her emotional well-being, as that is how she *gives support to her friends. A Leo, on the other hand, doesn't make her *emotions her main focus, does not let the little things get to her and is *grounded in reality as much as she could be, virtually having little to no *imagination. She doesn't comprehend how a Pisces girl relies on her *emotions, as there are more obvious ways to handle situations rationally. *A Leo will look down on a Pisces as weak. I mean, do you think a lion *could ever be friends with a fish? Absolutely not. The fish will be *swallowed up whole, in an instant, with no second thought of it from *the lion*
