Pet Peeve*CONVERSATIONS THAT DON'T INVOLVE YOU*Awkward silence bothers you, but not as much as being surrounded by *conversations you're not a part of.

Rather than be jealous of people, they stand up and *root for them.*
Advice*While you have a free-spirited aura about you, dear Gemini, you also tend *to weigh other people opinions too heavily in how you choose to live your *life. Remember that only you can decide how you want to live, not others. *No one knows but you what truly makes you happy, so always follow your *heart, even if other people don’t see your vision.

Gemini + Taurus*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*
Gemini + Gemini*Those with the same signs are usually have the most obvious compatible*relationship. This relationship usually means that both people have come to*not only love themselves but managed to find another person with the same*qualities. Dating someone of the same sign means you've embraced your quirks*and accepted them.*
Gemini + Cancer*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*

Gemini + Virgo*These signs have a sexy dynamic tension. That angle is one where the *couple might fight or break up a lot, but they also can't resist each other.*There's a tension between the signs that keeps it hot.*
Gemini + Libra*If your partner shares the same element as you, the relationship is sure to *be easygoing and familiar. You feel so understood on a core level. But a *little extra effort is required for keeping the passion alive — you'll *need to make sure you maintain some independence in this relationship.*
Gemini + Scorpio*These pairings are complex but can lead to an intense bond with a deep *level of intimacy. Though the partnership won't always work because you're*so astrologically different, it can be magical if you find the right person.*
Gemini + Sagittarius*Signs that are directly across from yours on the Zodiac circular vector *system can make a great romantic pairing. You can be polar opposites who *want to kill each other or you can be the yin to each others' yang. Your *pair will be like a mirror to parts of yourself that you are not aware of. *Together you can discover new things about each other.*
Gemini + Capricorn*These pairings are complex but can lead to an intense bond with a deep *level of intimacy. Though the partnership won't always work because you're*so astrologically different, it can be magical if you find the right person.*
Gemini + Aquarius*If your partner shares the same element as you, the relationship is sure to *be easygoing and familiar. You feel so understood on a core level. But a *little extra effort is required for keeping the passion alive — you'll *need to make sure you maintain some independence in this relationship.*
Gemini + Pisces*These signs have a sexy dynamic tension. That angle is one where the *couple might fight or break up a lot, but they also can't resist each other.*There's a tension between the signs that keeps it hot.*
Best Match*Aquarius: They get each other to the fullest, like they have known one *another for years even if it's only been months (or weeks). These two *signs are also big on creativity and ideas. They also enjoy their *independence. But this doesn't seem to bother the relationship, since *they both understand the importance of spending time apart to make the *heart grow fonder.*
Worst Match*Scorpio: Scorpio’s tendency to focus on the betterment of the self, as well *as it’s love of privacy, has a tendency to clash wildly with Gemini’s strong *need to be social and focus its energies outward instead. Gemini’s *superficial and light-hearted approach to life will no doubt cause problems *when mixed with Scorpio’s brooding, inflexible intensity. If the two can *learn to speak each other’s languages, then Scorpio’s dynamism could be *good when paired with Gemini’s ingenuity, but this is difficult if not *impossible to achieve.*
Don't Ignore It*You have the tendency to brush the matter off insisting it isn't important.*But sometimes, you need to understand that it's okay to have feelings and*it doesnt make you weak or lesser by letting your emotions*
Gemini + Aries*This is an incredibly dynamic friendship that seems to run on rocket fuel.*Aries loves putting Gemini's brilliant ideas into practice. Gemini has fun*egging Aries on to glory. Together, great things can be accomplished. These*two friends make wonderful creative collaborators. The only downside to *this alliance is a tendency toward heedlessness. Aries has no fear of *danger and Gemini is always eager to see what's around the corner. This *can cause some unfortunate accidents. The best gifts these friends can *give each other is safety equipment*
Gemini + Taurus*Practical Taurus and whimsical Gemini have different approaches to life. *Taurus doesn't like to take risks, while Gemini loves exploring new *horizons. The Bull craves security, while the Twins yearn for variety. *When these two signs do form a friendship, it's usually on the basis of a *mutual interest. Both Taurus and Gemini place a strong emphasis on hobbies.*There's a good chance they could connect in a cooking, foreign language, or *art class or workshop. Taurus appreciates Gemini's brilliant insights, *while Gemini admires Taurus' great taste.*
Gemini + Gemini*Geminis have a knack for spotting each other from across a crowded room. *They're usually in crowded rooms, since they are such social creatures. *Intelligent, witty, and charming, Gemini loves a good discussion. That's *why they enjoy the company of other Twins. Masters of trivia, these two *friends swap facts and anecdotes the way kids trade baseball cards. When *these two get bored of one another, they'll easily part ways but then come *together later, when they have more stories to share. Jealousy is rarely *part of this friendship's equation.*
Gemini + Cancer*This friendship doesn't come naturally, but it can be very rewarding. *Gemini is highly intellectual, while Cancer is extremely emotional. *The two friends have radically different reactions to life, which is a *good thing. Gemini can help Cancer realize that while feelings are *important, they can be controlled. Cancer will show Gemini the value in *forming lasting, heartfelt relationships. The Twins don't understand the *Moon Child's obsession with economic stability. Conversely, Cancer doesn't *get why Gemini can't sit still for two minutes. Mostly, they laugh at *each other's quirks.*
Gemini + Leo*Effusive and affectionate, Gemini and Leo form a fast friendship. They form*a mutual admiration society that is positively addictive. Gemini is quick *to appreciate Leo's style, creative talent, and warmth. Leo loves laughing *at Gemini's witty remarks. These two are very adventurous and enjoy getting*into trouble together. Fortunately, Gemini is an expert at talking their *way out of punishments. This is the one instance when Leo should follow *their friend's lead. At all other times, Gemini should defer to Leo's *sizable ego. This is a fun-loving pair.*
Gemini + Virgo*Although Gemini is an Air Sign and Virgo belongs to the Earth, these *friends do have lots in common. Both signs are ruled by the planet Mercury, *conferring high intelligence. These two love sharing book, film, and music *recommendations. They also collaborate very well. Gemini prefers to *generate the ideas, while Virgo is great at implementing them. Gemini *bristles at the Virgin's quest for perfection, while Virgo is exasperated *by the Twins' refusal to take work seriously. Still, each admires the *other's special brand of wisdom.*
Gemini + Libra*Gemini and Libra are boon companions that adore one another. As soon as *these two get together, they are laughing and exchanging ideas. They love *making plans together, but rarely stick to the planned out program. That's *because both these signs go where the wind takes them, easily abandoning a *good prospect for a great one. There are some complications with this *friendship. The Twins lack Libra's diplomatic skills, while Libra is a *bit too dependent for Gemini's taste. Fortunately, neither of them holds *a grudge.*
Gemini + Scorpio*Gemini and Scorpio each have their own ideas about how life should be *conducted. Neither can be easily converted. That's why it can be difficult *for these signs to form a friendship. When they do, it's usually because *they appreciate each other's incisive thinking. Gemini is extremely well *informed and can support their arguments with compelling facts and *figures. Scorpio isn't afraid to shatter taboos and challenge limiting *attitudes. Independent Gemini finds Scorpio's jealousy distasteful, *while passionate Scorpio can't comprehend Gemini's composure. They do *appreciate each other's keen intellects.*
Gemini + Sagittarius*Gemini likes fiction while Sagittarius prefers biographies. The Twins *want to hear all the gory details while the Archer is only interested in *the big picture. Gemini can see many sides of a given issue, while *Sagittarius insists there is only one truth. Although these two signs come *at life from radically different directions, they can still form a solid *friendship. They both love to travel. A shared love of the written word is *another bond. In addition, these two are great students. Their friendship *is a miniature classroom.*
Gemini + Capricorn*The Twins exude youthful energy, while the Goat is an old soul. If these *two can manage to let down their defenses, they can form a helpful *friendship. Gemini can bring Capricorn up to date on the latest trends. *Capricorn can give Gemini an appreciation for tradition. Although the *Twins will never buy into the Goat's pessimistic outlook, while Capricorn *will not care for Gemini's inability to handle money, they can have fun *together. Each has a terrific sense of humor. Gemini's irreverence mixes *well with Capricorn's sardonic wit.*
Gemini + Aquarius*These two signs have an instant affinity for each other. Curious Gemini *loves hearing about Aquarius's latest theories. Aloof Aquarius admires *Gemini's ability to make friends with people from all walks of life. These *two love attending parties together, separating once they arrive and *then coming together to exchange notes afterward. At times, the Twins will *groan about the Water Bearer's stubborn attitude. At others, Aquarius *will sigh impatiently over Gemini's inability to follow through with *promises. In the end, they'll set these criticisms aside and enjoy each *other's company.*
Gemini + Pisces*Gemini and Pisces are two totally different people who have lots to *teach each other. Gemini is great at shaking off disappointment and *finding fresh opportunities. Pisces is adept at forming meaningful *relationships that last a lifetime. If the Twins can endure Pisces's *emotional rollercoaster and the Fish can put up with Gemini's neuroses, *these two can be good friends. Gemini is impressed with Pisces's creative *talent, while Pisces thinks Gemini is as smart as a whip. They're both *versatile and can make allowances for each other's shortcomings.*
Gemini & Libra*A Libra is very easygoing. The Libra woman always wants to have peace *along with lots of great conversation and a little fun! A Gemini is the *same way, making these two easy BFFs. Gemini women love having fun but are *easygoing enough that they can also kick back and have a night in with *their best friend instead. A Gemini is a little more flexible, too, so this *helps their friendship when a Libra doesn't feel like doing something or *might not want to. Even though a Libra can turn off and become very *unemotional and sarcastic when threatened, a Gemini will rarely set a Libra *off, so when this does actually happen, a Gemini is able to bounce back *from it with virtually no problems. These two are too close to let quick *emotions get the best of them*
Gemini & Taurus*This one is a toss-up, but there is virtually no one after hearing these *things that will have hope for Gemini women and Taurus girls being best *friends. Their personalities are very different. A Gemini is very flexible, *never having too many problems with last-minute changes in her life.  *A Taurus is incredibly inflexible, so you think this friendship would *work, right? A Gemini girl could just follow suit to the controlling *Taurus woman. But, no. The problem is how pessimistic a Taurus can be. *On the other hand, a Gemini is incredibly optimistic, so over time, she *will grow sick of the Taurus girl and her negativity. On top of this, a *Taurus can have a terrible temper and a Gemini, even though flexible, *can be very moody and devious, capable of doing things that they could *regret. This friendship would eventually turn into a battle over time*
