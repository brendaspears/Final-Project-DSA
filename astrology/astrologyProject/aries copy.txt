Fire can keep you warm, or it can do great destruction.*While fire burns out quickly without fuel to keep it going,*it can also regenerate its power from the ashes.*A single spark can set off a forest fire. As a result,*fire signs need to be nurtured and managed carefully.*

Your Color is Red*The color red stirs Aries’ soul and enhances passion, energy, and*initiative. It’s the color of excitement and assertion, which supports*Aries’ active nature and eagerness for life. Red demands attention -- and*Aries is a sign that doesn’t like to be ignored. It’s also no surprise*that Aries’ ruling planet, Mars, is known as 'The Red Planet'*The more shades of red Aries surrounds itself with, the greater their*natural powers can be.*

Your Ruling House is 1st House of Self*As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries rules the 1st House of Self. *The 1st house is a representation of your overall self -- the personality *and traits that make you uniquely you. Aries' connection to the 1st House *of Self speaks to this sign's pioneering nature, its bravery, and *independence. Aries' desire to create, identify, and deepen its sense of *self is what the 1st house is all about. *

Versatile.*Since their constant thirst of adventures, an Aries often tries new things*in the life.*4. Lively.*The typical Aries is extremely energetic, there is no way for you to miss it.*5.

The Trendsetter Friend*Aries, you’re the Trendsetter Friend because you love to try anything new. *Whether it’s a new style or that weird, smoking shot at your favorite bar, *you’re down to try something at least once.**You’re also an initiator, which means you love to get the party *started when your friends seem totally bored, and you’re also not *afraid to speak your mind if it means bringing new ideas to your squad.**As an Aries, you’re a natural-born leader who always feels like the most *comfortable place in your squad is the one where you get to call all the *shots. And because you always seem to exude confidence and fearlessness, *your squad happily lets you lead the pack — as long as you lead like a *friend and not with an iron fist.*
Famous Celebrities*Lady Gaga*Emma Watson*Robert Downey, Jr.*James Franco*Reese Witherspoon*Quentin Tarantino*
Pet Peeve*A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF COMPETITION*You're used to dominating the competition, so when people actually start *bringing in their A-game, you're secretly livid. I bet you start making a *bunch of excuses as to why you're not winning, but have you ever heard of *something called 'sportsmanship'?*
Losing on all Levels*Aries has a competitive spirit and likes to win every time. You want to *make a Ram unhappy? And beat him in any aspect of his life. Victory is his *motto and defeat is in his eyes a shame, a humiliation, even the end of the *world. All his life is in question and generates in Aries a great *depression.*
Fear & Insecurity*Aries biggest fear is the fear of going unnoticed or being forgotten. They *want to make a mark on the world, and they like to have many accomplishments *and achievements under their belt. The thought that these could be forgotten *one day is a fear that a lot of Aries can struggle with.**The most common insecurity of an Aries is that they sometimes feel lost but *will never ask for advice from others. As mentioned, Aries are confident *go-getters and want to accomplish lots of things, so if other people need *advice they are happy to give it. Aries just aren’t as comfortable with *asking for advice themselves. They need to find a balance and know that *it’s OK to ask for help.*
5th Most Jealous*Aries are both passionate and moody, leading them to be overwhelmed with *envy. When an Aries is jealous, they act quickly on it. They have a tendency *to be short-tempered, leading them to act based on their emotions, even if *they really don’t want to. Aries don’t experience as much jealousy as the *other signs, but when they do, you should run.*
Advice*Don’t make any decisions until you’ve had time to thoroughly think things *through. Aries tend to jump the gun in many situations, either out of *excitement, frustration, impatience, or all three. However, it does pay *off to think about a choice before you act on it, because as we know,*every action bears a consequence. Sure, taking risks can result in huge *rewards, too, but even risk-takers weigh the pros and cons of their *decisions before making them.*
Aries + Aries*Those with the same signs are usually have the most obvious compatible*relationship.

Dating someone of the same sign means you've embraced your quirks*and accepted them.*
Aries + Taurus*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*
Aries + Gemini*This romance should feel exactly like dating your best friend — just with *more sexual chemistry. Your communication should be stellar, though you'll *probably need to work a little harder to keep the spark alive and ensure *you don't slip into being just friends.*
Aries + Cancer*These signs have a sexy dynamic tension. That angle is one where the *couple might fight or break up a lot, but they also can't resist each other.*There's a tension between the signs that keeps it hot.*
Aries + Leo*If your partner shares the same element as you, the relationship is sure to *be easygoing and familiar. You feel so understood on a core level.

Aries + Virgo*These pairings are complex but can lead to an intense bond with a deep *level of intimacy. Though the partnership won't always work because you're*so astrologically different, it can be magical if you find the right person.*
Aries + Libra*Signs that are directly across from yours on the Zodiac circular vector *system can make a great romantic pairing.

Your *pair will be like a mirror to parts of yourself that you are not aware of. *Together you can discover new things about each other.*
Aries + Scorpio*These pairings are complex but can lead to an intense bond with a deep *level of intimacy. Though the partnership won't always work because you're*so astrologically different, it can be magical if you find the right person.*
Aries + Sagittarius*If your partner shares the same element as you, the relationship is sure to *be easygoing and familiar. You feel so understood on a core level. But a *little extra effort is required for keeping the passion alive — you'll *need to make sure you maintain some independence in this relationship.*
Aries + Capricorn*These signs have a sexy dynamic tension. That angle is one where the *couple might fight or break up a lot, but they also can't resist each other.*There's a tension between the signs that keeps it hot.*

Aries + Pisces*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*
Best Match*Leo: If Leo and Aries can master the fine art of learning to share the *spotlight with one another, and can learn to give as well as they get when *it comes to admiration and praise, this can be a highly energetic and *special union. It is also a union that makes for an active and *adventurous sex life, as they are very much compatible when it comes to the *bedroom.*
Worst Match*Capricorn: Both Capricorn and Aries are natural-born leaders, but *unfortunately they have very different ways of going about it and can’t *help but lock horns. These two are very likely to fight over money manners, *as Aries is something of a spendthrift, while Capricorn is very frugal. *Aries also likes variety and novelty, while Capricorn is staunchly *traditional, providing even more fertile ground for discord. In short, *these two are opposites in all the wrong ways.*
Move On*You spend your time thinking that it's wrong to let go and move one because*of what you had. But it's okay to move on. You are not a failure just*because your relationship is over. You can find someone better. It's okay.*
Aries + Aries*These two signs are molded by the planet Mars, so they'll lock horns *frequently in small spats. Occasionally, they'll take things up a notch and *create some real drama together. Aries are very protective of their *personal space, so each member of this team should take pains to respect *the other's domain. When these two show respect for each other's talent, *things will go smoothly. They should also take turns assuming the *leadership role. When forming a united front, nothing can stop this dynamic *duo.*
Aries + Taurus*Aries likes to look before they leap. Taurus prefers weighing their *options. This dynamic can result in power struggles or it can be mutually *beneficial. Aries can help Taurus become more strategically spontaneous, *springing into action at the opportune moment. Taurus will assist Aries in *getting better value from their work, relationships, and creative efforts. *Occasionally, it will be best to leave each other alone. Trying to change *one another will just undermine the value of this friendship. Viva la *difference!*
Aries + Gemini*This is an incredibly dynamic friendship that seems to run on rocket fuel. *Aries loves putting Gemini's brilliant ideas into practice. Gemini has fun *egging Aries on to glory. Together, great things can be accomplished. *These two friends make wonderful creative collaborators. The only downside *to this alliance is a tendency toward heedlessness. Aries has no fear of *danger and Gemini is always eager to see what's around the corner. This *can cause some unfortunate accidents. The best gifts these friends can give *each other is safety equipment.*
Aries + Cancer*When these two Cardinal signs get together, amazing things can happen. *Both Aries and Cancer are wonderful leaders. Aries is willing to take *creative risks to succeed, while Cancer is able to tap into public *sentiment. As a result, these friends may spend much of their time *developing ideas for businesses, fundraisers and parties. At times, *Aries's direct approach will send shy Cancer scuttling for cover. At *others, Cancer's guilt trips will dampen Aries's enthusiasm. For the most *part, though, these friends appreciate and celebrate each other's strengths*
Aries + Leo*Bold Aries and fun-loving Leo generate lots of excitement together! *That's because both these friends are Fire Signs. Aries is the more *outgoing of the two and may prefer seeking adventure while Leo luxuriates *in comfort, waiting for a full report. These friends are also extremely *active and may enjoy playing sports, thus bringing out each other's *competitive side. Neither sign is a particularly gracious loser, so some *heated arguments can erupt on the field or court. For the most part, *however, each friend will bask in the other's glow.*
Aries + Virgo*Heroic Aries and helpful Virgo are both service-oriented people. They may *strike up a friendship while doing volunteer work or performing some *selfless task. Although Aries doesn't have a filter and says whatever pops *into his or her mind, Virgo is extremely conscientious and carefully *censors their words. Aries thinks Virgo is too sensitive, while Virgo *feels Aries is bombastic. Fortunately, the Ram appreciates it when the *Virgin fixes their public relations disasters, while Virgo is grateful *when Aries pushes them to take risks. Each brings something valuable to *the other's table.*
Aries + Libra*Independent Aries and collaborative Libra form a funny sort of friendship. *Aries tries convincing Libra to take chances, shake off criticism, and be *more direct. Libra constantly tells Aries to slow down, smell the flowers, *and be more appreciative. It's an odd couple type of relationship that can *work extremely well. Aries can learn the fine art of diplomacy from Libra, *while Libra may become more assertive thanks to Aries. At times, they'll *go their separate ways. Aries will head for the sports arena, while Libra *will visit a museum. They need their own friends, not just one *exclusive clique.*
Aries + Scorpio*Daring Aries and passionate Scorpio form an explosive friendship. These *two love getting into trouble together. Going to extremes is their idea of *fun. Occasionally, the authorities might have to be called! Fortunately, *Scorpio is an expert at getting out of messes. When they can't slip *through the net, Aries usually can help them break free with a lot of fast *talking. When they're getting along, these two can move mountains. However,*a tendency to make mountains out of molehills will cause some heated fights.*
Aries + Sagittarius*Dynamic Aries and adventurous Sagittarius feel an instant affinity. Both *these Fire Signs like to keep moving, partying long into the night. Aries *is more interested in what is hot and new, while Sagittarius has a *reverence for time-honored traditions. These different tastes can actually *bolster their friendship. Aries enjoys Sagittarius's ability to make any *lesson fun, while Sagittarius is amused by Aries's boundless enthusiasm. *Together, these two can paint the town red. A shared love of sports could *prompt meetings at the gym, playing field, or other athletic arena.*
Aries + Capricorn*Youthful Aries and seasoned Capricorn form an odd friendship. While Aries *is always looking forward, Capricorn prefers to look back. If each puts *forth some effort, they can meet in the present. Both these signs are *remarkable leaders and will enjoy building things of lasting value. Aries *is great at knocking on doors and launching sales initiatives. Capricorn *is proficient at creating long-term financial security. Together, these *friends can reach great heights. The key is for these two to always be *working on a challenging project.*
Aries + Aquarius*Pioneering Aries and unique Aquarius have lots in common. Both have a deep *appreciation for unorthodox ideas and new methods. These trailblazers make *fast friends. Aries is a lot more excitable than steadfast Aquarius. *Aquarius is much more stubborn than active Aries. At times, these two will *argue about money, romantic relationships, and work. So long as they don't *try to control each other, these spats will be quick and painless. Neither *should attempt strong-arm tactics. Both signs cherish their independence *and resent being told what to do.*
Aries + Pisces*Forthright Aries and reserved Pisces form an unlikely friendship. Although *the Ram is bold and outgoing and the Fish is shy and reclusive, they do *have some things in common. Both are highly sensitive to criticism. Aries *tends to lash out when hurt, while Pisces usually turns silent. Neither is *a stranger to pain. By bolstering each other's egos, these two can be a *strong support system. Aries encourages Pisces to develop their creative *talent, while Pisces assures Aries their innovative instincts are right on *target.*
Aries & Leo*An Aries and a Leo are best friends for several reasons. Where do I start?*First, we know a Leo loves to have control, is abrasive and confrontational,*yet has incredibly leadership skills. An Aries girl has great leadership *skills as well, but knows when to let things go and let someone else take *control. She absolutely does not need control, like a Leo girl. *Furthermore, they are both direct and can be honest with each other no *matter what the case is. Lastly, they are both incredibly independent, *so they can hang out with each other and do their own thing or make plans *together too. Ironically, they are very chill around each other, even *though they can be really uptight in every other aspect of life.*
Aries & Cancer*An Aries could never relate or support a Cancer. Why? Well, first of all, *a Cancer's emotional state is sporadic and unpredictable. Even though it *is a positive trait to feel everything so fully, sometimes for a Cancer's *friend it can be very overwhelming to support when you feel like nothing *is helping them feel better. An Aries literally does not have the emotional *capacity to handle this. They simply do not want to deal with emotion and *will bluntly speak, often hurting other's feelings in the process. *Further, while an Aries is very much independent, a Cancer is capable of *this as well, but often needs to lean on other's for support when they *cannot calm their emotions. These two wouldn't work as a friendship for *too long.*
