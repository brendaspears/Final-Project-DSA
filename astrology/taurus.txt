Your Element is Earth*Earth signs keep it real. They are the “grounded” people on the *planet, the ones who bring us down to earth and remind us to *start with a solid foundation. Slow and steady, these “builders”*are loyal and stable, and stick by their people through hard times. *On good days, they’re practical; at worst, they can be materialistic or*too focused on the surface of things to dig into the depths.*
Your Flower is the Poppy*People born under the Taurus sign are strong, compassionate, and love *being surrounded by love and natural beauty. Similar to a poppy flower*they stand their ground (especially on matters they’re passionate about)*and exude beauty and positivity.*
Your Gemstone is Amber*Amber is not actually a stone, but the petrified resin of trees that once*grew in forests along the Baltic sea -- appropriately earthy*origins for nature-loving Taurus. Amber's gold-orange color is known for*grounding and stabilizing higher spiritual energies into the physical body.*Its influence is simultaneously calming and energizing, enhancing patience,*protection and balance. Amber is said to absorb negative energy, thereby*promoting the body's ability to heal itself.**Additional gemstones associated with Taurus: *Rose Quartz*Turquoise*Blood Coral*Emerald*Sapphire*
Your Ruling Planet is Venus*You're a pretty practical person, but you've been known to indulge a lot.*You just can't help that you appreciate the finer things in life,* especially because Venus is your ruling planet. Venus is the cause of your*love for beauty and all things fancy in the world. It will make sure you*enjoy a life of luxury, because you deserve it.*
Your Color is Green*Fresh green nurtures Taurus’ spirit and reinforces its connection to nature*and growth. Just like the lush pastures the Bull resides in, green*represents growth, and Taurus is a sign of absolute progress. The return*of green in the springtime -- Taurus’ season -- further enhances its*connection to this sign.*
Your Tarot Card is The Hierophant*Your card, The Hierophant, represents learning from knowledgeable teachers*who can help you search for higher truths by exploring tried and true*traditions. Sifting through the superficial, these learned souls can lead*you to the heart of matters where profound insights reveal important life*lessons.*
Your Ruling House is 2nd House of Worth*Cha-ching! Taurus, being the second sign of the zodiac, rules the 2nd House*of Worth. In Astrology, the 2nd House of Worth is a representation of your*values -- money, first and foremost, but also the things you value and find*beautiful, and your own sense of self-worth. Taurus’ love of luxury, beauty,*and material indulgence is represented strongly in this house.*

Possessive. *We can say that this is the major negative trait of Taurus which leads*to jealousy and resentment.*
The Traditional Lover*Family oriented Taurus always chooses to go for dates, spend time cuddling *you in bed. Taurus is the traditional lover who will do the usual things *couples do like go on a vacation together, watch movies together, etc. *Committed to their partner, the Taurus will always make you feel safe *and secured in the relationship.*
The Persistent Friend*Taurus, you are what’s known as the Persistent Friend. That means that *you’re the kind of person who never gives up whenever you set your own *goals, even when you feel like you’re being beaten down in life.*You’re like the superhero who still manages to rise from the rubble *even after getting your butt kicked, which only proves you can’t be beat down.**You also push your friends to take action in their own lives instead of*putting off the things they really want to do, but not in a pushy way. *You’re supportive and patient, but you’re also the “get it done” kind *of person that all of your friends love to hate. Sure, they roll *your eyes when you poke at them to push themselves, but they always *love you for it in the end.*

Pet Peeve*DOING THINGS SOMEONE ELSE'S WAY*You tend to believe that you've figured out the most efficient and effective*way to do something, so when you're forced to abide by someone else's * *method, you're holding back so much frustration. Point blank: If their *way was the right way, it would be your way.*
Losing Something They Think They Own*By its nature, Taurus is possessive and likes to hold everything around it, *be it a person or a material object. Never take the risk of stealing *something that belongs to him, even if it is a simple pen. They will roar *like a real bull and will become unhappy because of this loss.* 
Fear & Insecurity*Taurus’s most common fear: the fear of unexpected change. As Taurus’s love *stability and structure, it’s easy to see why they may fear change in their *life that could disrupt things.*Their insecurities also connect with their fear too. Taurus's biggest *insecurity is that they are always questioning what will come next. Because *security is a huge thing for Taurus’s, they often worry about change that *may be coming their way. They can sometimes worry about things that haven’t *happened yet, and as they crave stability, it can be hard to accept that *they don’t control the future.*
6th Most Jealous* *Even though Taurus tend to be possessive and insecure, they don’t usually *have a jealous side. A Taurus is patient and understanding enough to know *when or when not to act solely on an emotion. If a Taurus does happen to *show a little envy, something must be bothering them a lot.*
Advice*You might expect others to treat you how you treat them, and that would *hold true in a perfect world, but it doesn’t always work that way here. You *can give someone your whole heart, only to have it crushed and broken. *However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t love with your entire being, *because holding back could mean missing out on your one true love. Love *everyone you come across; the right one will never want to throw your love *away.*
Taurus + Aries*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*
Taurus + Taurus*Those with the same signs are usually have the most obvious compatible*relationship.

Taurus + Gemini*It can be very hard to get on the same page.This pairing is more difficult *due to intense differences in personality and style (which might lead to *awkwardness), but that same conflict could lead to a healthy relationship *that forces each person to grow and exit their fear-based comfort zones.*

Best Match*Pisces: Taurus and Pisces are similar in all the right ways. Both great *lovers of peace, beauty, art, and music, the two together are capable of *building a wonderful, harmonious relationship together that is full of *everything they both crave. These two are also different in all the right *ways as well. Taurus’s stability and dependability helps dreamy Pisces *keep its feet on the ground, while Pisces’s imagination and intuition will *add a much-needed sense of wonder to Taurus’s world.*
Worst Match*Aquarius: Aquarius’s careless, detached attitude toward many aspects of *life (relationships included) has a tendency to rub security-loving, *sensitive Taurus the wrong way. They can also be like oil and water in many *other ways as well. Aquarians are innovative while Taureans are traditional. *Aquarius thinks broadly in humanitarian terms while Taurus is more *concerned with its immediate environment. Often Aquarius finds Taurus too *needy and clingy, while Taurus finds Aquarius far too cold and flighty.*
Be Carefree*You are the number one when it comes to coping mechanisms when getting over*a breakup. However, being overly-prepared may not be a very good thing!*Learn how to love with your eyes closed and stop looking for exits. Taking*risks in love will not kill you.*
Taurus + Aries*Aries likes to look before they leap. Taurus prefers weighing their options.*This dynamic can result in power struggles or it can be mutually beneficial.*Aries can help Taurus become more strategically spontaneous, springing into *action at the opportune moment. Taurus will assist Aries in getting better *value from their work, relationships, and creative efforts. Occasionally, it*will be best to leave each other alone. Trying to change one another will *just undermine the value of this friendship. Viva la difference!*
Taurus + Taurus*When two Bulls form a friendship, pure pleasure ensues. These two have *highly developed senses. A deep appreciation for food, art, and luxury *usually brings them together. A profound love of relaxation cements their *bond. Although this pair may not accomplish very much together, they'll *have a great time nonetheless. They love nothing more than kicking back, *relaxing and laughing together. When they disagree, neither will budge, *so that can be difficult. If they argue over where to eat or which movie *to see, it's best to flip a coin.*
Taurus + Gemini*Practical Taurus and whimsical Gemini have different approaches to life. *Taurus doesn't like to take risks, while Gemini loves exploring new *horizons. The Bull craves security, while the Twins yearn for variety. *When these two signs do form a friendship, it's usually on the basis of a *mutual interest. Both Taurus and Gemini place a strong emphasis on hobbies.*There's a good chance they could connect in a cooking, foreign language, or*art class or workshop. Taurus appreciates Gemini's brilliant insights, *while Gemini admires Taurus' great taste.*
Taurus + Cancer*Taurus and Cancer often feel an immediate kinship. Both are *security-conscious. They take pleasure in steady jobs, loving families, *and comfortable homes. They're both very creative, too, and enjoy *collaborating on everything from meals to gardens to handicrafts. Sometimes *Taurus seems too obsessed with money for Cancer's taste, while Cancer *appears overly sensitive to Taurus. For the most part, each is able to *tolerate the other's weaknesses. Instead of trying to change one another, *both signs choose to celebrate their friend's strong points. That's the *secret of this strong friendship.*
Taurus + Leo*Taurus and Leo have more in common than meets the eye. Both love luxury. *Each is extremely loyal. The two of them are incredibly stubborn. When they*become friends, it's usually because they appreciate each other's taste. *These two can often be found shopping, eating, and making or appreciating *art together. Taurus hates being ordered around, which can cause problems *when Leo issues royal commands. Leo dislikes Taurus's frugality. *Fortunately, they're both very friendly. Most days, they prefer having *fun to fighting.*
Taurus + Virgo*Taurus and Virgo form a strong friendship that can stand the test of time.*While it's true that Taurus is slow to admit mistakes and Virgo is quick *to point out errors, these two rarely argue. That's because they both *value stability. Taurus knows how to spot good values and help Virgo *make the most of their money. Virgo knows how to read the fine print *and can assist Taurus in negotiating better deals. Together, they make *great allies. A shared love of nature cements their bond.*
Taurus + Libra*Although Taurus is an Earth Sign and Libra is an Air Sign, both are ruled *by Venus. This means that beauty, luxury, and harmony will be the *foundation of their friendship. Taurus is more highly attuned to physical *representations of beauty, like colorful jewels, delicious food, and rich *textures. Libra prefers ethereal types of art, like writing, music, and *poetry. They love talking about their favorite artists. Taurus despairs *of Libra's spendthrift ways and Libra thinks Taurus is overly stubborn, *but they'd never dream of levying insults at each other.*
Taurus + Scorpio*Taurus and Scorpio usually eye each other warily before forming a *friendship. Straight-shooting Taurus is suspicious of mysterious Scorpio, *while passionate Scorpio can't fathom Taurus's calm demeanor. If the two *of these signs spend enough time together, they can become friends. Taurus *will teach Scorpio to laugh at life's absurdity. Scorpio will help Taurus *obey its sensual desires. When these two fight, it is epic. Taurus is *stubborn and Scorpio never forgets a slight. They find each other so *fascinating, though, that it is hard for them to stay apart.*
Taurus + Sagittarius*Stable Taurus can have a hard time connecting with adventuresome *Sagittarius. The Bull loves peace and quiet, while the Archer craves *excitement. Finding common ground is difficult, but it can be done. *Both of these signs are straightforward. Therefore, they appreciate *each other's honesty. When Taurus wants to know if they are being *cheap or stubborn, Sagittarius will tell them. If Sagittarius is wondering *whether they're behaving irresponsibly, Taurus will say so. This is a *friendship grounded in reality checks*
Taurus + Capricorn*Taurus and Capricorn make fast friends, reveling in each other's *dependability. Taurus can count on Capricorn to show up on time to every *meeting. Capricorn knows Taurus will pay back a loan or return borrowed *items. Best of all, both these signs share a profound appreciation for *the great outdoors. Hanging out in forests, gardens, and parks is lots of *fun for these nature lovers. Each delights in the other's sense of humor. *When times get tough, they make each other laugh. These two have got each *other's backs.*
Taurus + Aquarius*Taurus and Aquarius don't have much in common, but they do have a shared *love of security. Each sign respects the other's ability to see projects *through to the end and stand by their loved ones. Although Taurus loves *creature comforts and Aquarius hates being tied down by possessions, they *do like to get good value for their money. Neither buys into the throwaway *culture of modern life. Taurus will roll their eyes at Aquarius's offbeat *tastes and Aquarius will call Taurus narrow-minded, but they're too *laid-back to fight.*
Taurus + Pisces* *Factual Taurus may not seem to have much in common with fantastic Pisces *at first glance. After scratching each other's surfaces, though, they'll *find a great deal in common. Both love beauty, art, and harmony. Each is *laid-back and agreeable. Taurus delights in making Pisces laugh, while *Pisces enjoys getting Taurus to loosen up. The Bull won't appreciate *Pisces's forgetful ways, while the Fish will shake their head at Taurus's *material concerns. Fortunately, both signs are very tolerant and will *refrain from scolding each other.*
Taurus & Virgo* *A practical and strong Taurus, as we know, is a pillar to anyone they know. *She is reliable, smart, and loyal. She gives more than she gets and does *not ask for anything in return. A kind and analytical Virgo is a great *friend as well. She is sensible and realistic and does not get in her head *with any choice or decision. These two are very similar and they revel in *their down-to-earth dispositions and patience with those around them that *weigh too heavily on their emotions. The only way these two could even *almost possibly not get along is due to Taurus' stubborn and opinionated *ways and Virgo's overly critical demeanor. Luckily they are both so *realistic and practical that a disagreement wouldn't last too long!*
Taurus & Gemini*This one is a toss-up, but there is virtually no one after hearing these *things that will have hope for Gemini women and Taurus girls being best *friends. Their personalities are very different. A Gemini is very flexible, *never having too many problems with last-minute changes in her life.  *A Taurus is incredibly inflexible, so you think this friendship would *work, right? A Gemini girl could just follow suit to the controlling *Taurus woman. But, no. The problem is how pessimistic a Taurus can be. *On the other hand, a Gemini is incredibly optimistic, so over time, she *will grow sick of the Taurus girl and her negativity. On top of this, a *Taurus can have a terrible temper and a Gemini, even though flexible, *can be very moody and devious, capable of doing things that they could *regret. This friendship would eventually turn into a battle over time*
